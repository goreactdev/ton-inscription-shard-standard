In conclusion, the Item Inscription Standard is a critical step towards a more unified, secure, and user-friendly environment for the TON blockchain. It lays the groundwork for a thriving ecosystem where digital assets can be created, traded, and enjoyed with confidence and ease.

## Deployment
Deployment involves initializing **Items** or **Ð¡ollections** on the blockchain. It requires legally compliant JSON formatting. 

The initial step is to deploy the collection to the owner address. You must send a transaction from your (owner) address to your (owner) address to deploy the **Collection**. So the creator of the collection will be the address. You will then need to get a unique hash of the transaction (**collection_hash**) that you can use to deploy the **Item**. 

**Item** for a certain collection can be created only on the address of the **collection's** owner. The mechanism is exactly the same - you need to send transactions from your address to your address with an **Item**. In this way, it is possible to trace the entire chain of a collection or items and ensure that the data is intact and cannot be compromised. 

#### WARNING
**The external hash for transactions is not unique and you should not use it to bind items or collection. If indexed incorrectly, items and collections may be compromised. Always verify a collection and item by internal hash.**

#### Use Cases

1. **Deploying a Collection**
   - **Scenario:** A user initiates a collection on the TON blockchain.
   - **Process:** The user sends a transaction from their address to their address with the specified JSON structure for collection deployment.
   - **Example:**
     ```
     data:application/json,
       {
         "p": "shard",
         "op": "mint",
         "t": "collection",

            "social_links": []
         }
       }
     ```
   - **Collection Hash:** Upon deployment, a unique `collection_hash` is generated.

2. **Minting an Item**
   - **Scenario:** A user wants to create an item within a deployed collection.
   - **Process:** The user sends a transaction from their address to their address with the item JSON structure, referencing the `collection_hash`.
   - **Example:**
   ```
   data:application/json,
          {
            "p": "shard",
            "op": "mint",
            "t": "item",
            "collection_hash": "[transaction hash]",
            "metadata": {
               "name": "Item name",
               "description": "Description",
               "image": ""[gzipped and then base64-encoded image]"",
               "attributes": []
            }
          }
    ```
   - **Item Hash:** Each item receives a unique hash upon creation.

3. **Transferring an Item**
   - **Scenario:** An item owner wishes to transfer ownership to another user.
   - **Process:** The owner sends a transfer transaction using the item transfer JSON structure, specifying the `item hash`.

This specification outlines the technical details and provides real-world examples for using the Item Inscription Standard in the TON blockchain environment. It includes the necessary structures for deployment and transfer of collections and items, along with metadata standards and size limitations.
